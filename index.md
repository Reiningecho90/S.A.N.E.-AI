## Hello, Welcome to S.A.N.E.

Welcome to the official website for the S.A.N.E. AI. The nicknae for this AI is S.A.N.E. which stand for Semi-Artificial Neural Envoronment. this is the project I have been working on in my free time, and is also helping me to practice for the PCAP exam that I will be taking soon. As a young developer, I strive to make the best program I possibly can.

## About the Project

As said before, the AI is aiding me in achieving the PCAP Python certification after acquiring the PCAP. I am working hard to make the AI as streamlined as possible. The current rollout is Beta Version 1.1.0, this is the most recent stable rollout. All of the possible functions you can use can be found on the repository Wiki page here: https://github.com/Reiningecho90/S.A.N.E.-AI/wiki. I do no tplan to slow development anytime soon, and as always I hope to make this better constantly.

## Goals for the Future

The goals are lofty, but not out of reach. Eventually I would like S.A.N.E. to be completely local onto a 24/7, 365 server. As you may know, a server is not anything cheap, so consider becoming a Stargazer and like the GitHub page: https://github.com/Reiningecho90/S.A.N.E.-AI

You may be wondering why it no longer says no command line. Thats becasue version 1.4.1 introduced the GUI and its features to the scene! Check it out here: https://github.com/Reiningecho90/S.A.N.E.-AI/releases/tag/1.4.1

## Contact the Developer

As the AI is growing at a steady rate, we  are sure to miss some things, my GitHub profile is linked, and the email can be found there: https://github.com/Reiningecho90
