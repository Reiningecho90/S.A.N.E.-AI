# S.A.N.E.-AI
Repo for S.A.N.E. (more info can be found under the public project), this is my current project to assist in learning the basics of Python.

This is the new home for all of the testing scripts we will use from R&D in terms of security, data usage and more in the future such as the conversational algorithm, which is for now, on hold.

MAJOR UPDATE: Neural Network undergoing backend testing for a full SciKit Learn rework. This will all helped on the backend for now as it is just a concept.
