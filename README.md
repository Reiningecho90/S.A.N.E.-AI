UPDATES (Find in-depth updates in the project on my page):
- Purged to Update-Archive.txt (6/10/2021)
- Working on a possible email function for 1.3 or 1.4 (6/10/2021)
- Updates will be less apparent here due to most of my coding time being allocated toward studying for the PCAP exam (6/10/2021)
- Working through issues with the email function as of today (6/11/2021)
- The email function has to work with a local IP address, unfortunately this is too sensitive to store on a local computer and the email function development will be switched for a calendar management function. (6/14/2021)
- Working on the UI for 1.4 as all of the patches for 1.3 are finished. If the UI is partially complete and working by 1.4 it will be a hidden feature (6/16/2021)
- UI will include a list of function buttons that execute certain functions like the new calendar function (6/17/2021)
- All functions for 1.3 are finished, all that is left is exe testing then rollout next month (6/20/2021)
- Finished exe move and some minor testing, the completed code will be pushed when code is final (6/22/2011)
