# S.A.N.E.-AI
Repo for S.A.N.E. (more info can be found under the public project), this is my current project to assist in learning the basics of Python.

This is the section where you can find the main script, and the code it holds. The code has comments for an explanation on how it works if you get confused.

## Updates:
- Added comments and updated v1.1 script. These changes can be found in 'S.A.N.E. Assistant.py'
- Preparing to move th enew NN in for v1.2 testing (this could be the last beta before fullpublicity AKA S.A.N.E. 1.0)
