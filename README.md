# S.A.N.E.-Repo
Repo for S.A.N.E. (more info can be found under the public project), this is my current project to assist in learning the basics of Python. My current IDE of choice is PyCharm, I have attempted to migrate the files to VS Code although some of the ibraries were challenging to download, which will be countered later. Find all files to navigate the AI in the v1.0 release .txt wiles (SETUP.txt, USER-MANUAL.txt.txt, and VOICE COMMANDS.txt)

Explore the AI and please suggest what to do next or how to improve it!
