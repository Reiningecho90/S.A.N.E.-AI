## Security Measures
- Login Credentials: Users are required to supply login credentials to use S.A.N.E. as files may contain sensitive information during use.
- Voice Encryption: Through Google's voice API, all voice commands are encrypted meaning they are safe against attacks.
- Local Hosting: All files are hosted locally meaning large scale data breaches are nearly impossible.
- Data Wiping: All data is wiped from memory on shutdown so nothing sensitive is stored in the computer files.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you need to report a vulnerability in the code, email me with the email on my profile, and I will do my best to respond.
Make sure you know where the vulnerability is before you email, it would help if every vulnerability has very refined, down to a certain line or lines of code.
