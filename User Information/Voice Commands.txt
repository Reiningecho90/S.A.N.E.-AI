NOTES:

It is reccomended that you use headphones with a built in mic because the program 1. is programmed for mic optimization and 2 gets better quality with a nearer mic.

USE SIMPLE WORDING, THE MORE WORDS YOU USE THE LONGER IT TAKES TO RUN(test this out, I founc that with other programs running the best word count for S.A.N.E. was about 3-5 words and response time was about 2-3 seconds, if you only use the keywords it will be super short)

Sane will ask if you need help after a matter of minutes without talking due to how he is programmed. If you do not want this to happen calculate the number of seconds to hibernate for, although if he is hibernating he can not recieve commands. You can say 'yes' or 'no' to most of the questions he asks and get a relevant answer or prefrom a relevant action based on your answer.

Remember, S.A.N.E. is in beta, he will be optimized later so you can preform more actions quicker, and more!
